  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/svgs/
    - assets/html/
    - assets/logo.png
    - assets/history/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: CustomIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/CustomIcons.ttf 
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-ThinItalic.ttf
          weight: 100
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-LightItalic.ttf
          weight: 300
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-MediumItalic.ttf
          weight: 500
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-BoldItalic.ttf
          weight: 700
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-BlackItalic.ttf
